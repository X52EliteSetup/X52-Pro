# Using the tool to deploy and collect files

If you have already python and make, nothing to worry about, just run `make deploy` and `make collect`. 

If you don't have python, install it and put it in the path, or install it and modify the Makefile with the path to your python.exe

If you don't want to use make, check the Makefile on how to run the script and just do that.


# GOTchas when editing profiles

- the tool is shit. sorry, there is no way to put it softer. is just really bad. having said that, amazing people can get amazing results with it. I struggled.

- If you change 1 setting, in 1 of the modes, the other 3 will change too.

- If you want to change a setting, is better to do it first in the profile editor. 
  
    - If you want to change a setting that already has a button, and is assigned in ED, change it in the profile.

    - if it doesn't exist yet, add a key combination there. then go to E:D
